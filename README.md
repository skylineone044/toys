# toys

random things I programmed, because they were most likely more fun than doing
something else at the time

## eee.py

It convertc C/C++ code to eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

because why not right?

In theory the code it generates should also compile, but the preprocessor macros
pose a problem, and I only chose to deal with the `include` and `assert` macros

## julia.py

generate the julia sets of the mandlebrot set, given the requred parameters,
with the ability of generating still images, and animations as png sequences,
with multiple interpolation modes: line, circle
